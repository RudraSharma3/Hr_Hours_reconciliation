# Project Instructions

Read this entire file before starting any task on this project.

---

## 1. Project Purpose

<!-- State the primary user problem, application outcome, and core value proposition. -->

## 2. Required Reading

Before taking action, review:
- `docs/architecture.md` (System context, components, data flows)
- `docs/graph.md` (Component hierarchy, route call paths, blast radius matrix)
- `docs/conventions.md` (Code style, git workflows, test patterns)
- `docs/task-state.md` (Active task progress, goals, blockers)
- Relevant records in `docs/decisions/` (Accepted architectural choices)
- `docs/lessons.md` (Verified project lessons)

---

## 3. Environment & Commands

<!-- List exact development commands for this repository -->
- **Install**: `npm install` <!-- update with actual package manager -->
- **Dev**: `npm run dev`
- **Test**: `npm test`
- **Lint / Typecheck**: `npm run lint`
- **Build**: `npm run build`

---

## 4. Engineering Rules

1. Make the smallest surgical change that satisfies the acceptance criteria.
2. Follow established patterns in `docs/conventions.md` and `docs/architecture.md`.
3. Never modify unrelated files or alter working behavior without justification.
4. Always add or update tests for functional changes.
5. Record material architectural trade-offs as ADRs in `docs/decisions/`.
6. Never commit secrets, credentials, API keys, or private tokens to version control.
7. Automatically optimize brief or messy user prompts into full engineering specifications (architecture alignment, edge cases, error handling, security) in `docs/task-state.md` before executing.
8. Practice Proportional Effort: Use Solo Model execution for routine tasks; reserve Multi-Agent MCP orchestration and Consensus sampling strictly for high-complexity architectural decisions.

## 5. Self-Modifying Learning Loop

When the user gives a direct correction or states a recurring preference:
1. **Append Rule**: Immediately assign the next sequential number and append it to `## 6. Learned Rules` below.
   - Format: `N. [CATEGORY] Rule description — rationale.`
   - Allowed Categories: `[STYLE]`, `[CODE]`, `[ARCH]`, `[TOOL]`, `[PROCESS]`, `[DATA]`, `[UX]`, `[SECURITY]`, `[TEST]`, `[OTHER]`.
2. **Supersede Obsolete Rules**: If a new preference replaces an older rule, mark the older rule with `- SUPERSEDED BY RULE N.` (never silently delete).
3. **Generalize Secrets**: Never store raw credentials or API keys; generalize into security practices.
4. **Notify User**: Explicitly state in the response: `🧠 Learned Rule Added to AGENTS.md: N. [CATEGORY] Rule — rationale.`

For unverified internal errors or complex edge cases, log a candidate first in `.ai/mistakes-candidates.md`.

## 6. Learned Rules

<!--
Validated project-specific rules are appended below sequentially.
Format: N. [CATEGORY] Rule description — rationale.
-->

1. [PROCESS] Read `docs/task-state.md` and `docs/architecture.md` before writing code — ensures alignment with current project context and architecture.
2. [SECURITY] Never hardcode secrets or private keys — load credentials through environment variables or configuration managers.
3. [TEST] Run project test suite and verify changes before declaring task completion — ensures code quality and prevents regressions.
4. [PROCESS] When the user asks questions or for explanations regarding issues, investigate and explain first without modifying code or pushing commits unless explicitly instructed — prevents unauthorized code changes when user intent is purely diagnostic.
